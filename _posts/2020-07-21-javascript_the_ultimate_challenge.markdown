JavaScript: where to begin. I found JS to be a fairly challenging leap for me after becoming fairly fluent with Rails, Sinatra, and Ruby. To me, where Ruby was clean and easy to follow, JS was messy and overwhelming. 

I chose to do my JS and Rails project by leveraging Rails to expose data via an API and taking that data, a book and its reviews, to render on a page and offer different capabilities to interact with the exposed data. I found JS to be most challenging in moments when I was unsure about what code was running and when. Additionally, the scope of functions also threw me for a loop. One second, I'd be render a book on the page and the next, I would get errors in my console that I would need to track down. 

When building my project, I also went about things in a slightly backwards way: I built all of my code first and then remembered that JS classes make it *way* easier to organize information and run functions on it. I had to go back and refactor my code to take advantage of OOJS and the flexibility that it provides. 

In general, I enjoyed the challenge that this project bestowed upon me because it really forced me to track down each and every error to understand where in my application something was failing: was it the fetch, was it a separate function, was data not persisting to the database? I think the nature of JS is that it is cumbersome but if you put in the time to understand and follow its paths, it can be quite powerful. 

My project, on the UI, does not appear to be nearly as complicated as the 300+ lines of code that stand it up on the front-end are. With more time, I would love to keep this project going but simply style it a bit more and add more functionality and user logins. However, that's many lines of JS away! In the meantime, I enjoyed this project and enjoyed the challenge that it presented. I look forward to taking JS and applying it within the confines of a framework! On to React!
